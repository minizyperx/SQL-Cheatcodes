 SQL Injection Vulnerability
Overview
SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates an application's SQL queries by injecting malicious input. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or even full control of the database.

How It Works
Web applications often use SQL queries to interact with databases. When user inputs are not properly sanitized or validated, attackers can modify the structure of these queries. For example, consider the following query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'pass';
If an attacker inputs admin' -- as the username, the query becomes:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'anything';
This effectively bypasses the password check, allowing the attacker to log in as the admin user.

Types of SQL Injection
Classic SQL Injection: Direct manipulation of SQL queries through user inputs.
Blind SQL Injection: Infers information based on application behavior without direct feedback.
Union-Based SQL Injection: Combines results from different queries using the UNION operator.
Error-Based SQL Injection: Leverages error messages to gather information about the database.
Impact
Unauthorized Access: Attackers can gain access to user accounts, including admin accounts.
Data Theft: Sensitive information such as personal data and credit card numbers can be stolen.
Data Manipulation: Attackers can alter, delete, or corrupt database records.
Privilege Escalation: Attackers can escalate their privileges to execute administrative commands.
Prevention
Prepared Statements: Use parameterized queries to separate user input from code.
Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
Least Privilege: Ensure the database user account has only the necessary permissions.
Web Application Firewall (WAF): Use a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
Conclusion
SQL Injection remains one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, but it is also preventable with proper coding practices and security measures.
